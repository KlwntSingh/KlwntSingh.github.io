# Python  

## strings   

### unicode   

* standard which uses 24 bits to represent characters   

### codepoint   

* representing base16 value of character   

### encoding   

* converting unicode string into byte(value from 0-255)   

### UTF-8   

* uses 8 bit to represent characters   

### UTF-16   

* uses 16 bit to represent characters   

## difference   

### id, hash, is, == [anchor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34402522/difference-between-hash-and-id "anchor")  

* id - deals with reference   

#### hash - deals with value   

* calls __hash__ function of object   

* is - return true if reference is ame   

#### == - returns true if value is same   

* calls __eq__ function of object   

* default behaviour of == is 'is' for custom object if __eq__ function is not defined   

#### In Java   

* equals   

* hash   

##### ==   

* to check the reference   

* There is contract between equals and hash.equals tells about the state of object, hash make it easy to see if two objects are equal or not rather than comparing complete object state   

## list   

* append   

* extend   

* sort   

### pop   

* returns the element to be popped from any position   

### remove   

* returns none   

* split   

### +   

* does not modify the original list, but return the new concatenated list   

* all list methods return None and they change the list   

## dictionary   

### hashtable   

* assiciative array   

* hash function   

* during collision maintains list of values   

### histogram   

* function which outputs counter dictionary   

* keys are not in particular order   

* len	function ouputs no. of key-value pairs   

* immutable types can be used as keys   

### .items   

* this function returns list of tuples with key and values of dictionary being elements of tuples   

### if tuple of two elements is passed to dictionary   

* we get dictionary   

### for all built-in datatypes, which are not immutable, cannot be used as key   

* eg: list, dict, set etc   

## tuple   

### *   

* to represent tuple as comma separtedvalues   

### **   

* to represent dictionary as comma separated   

### zip   

* function creates list of tuples   

### enumerate   

* create list of tuples with index and element   

### comparison operators   

* <, > etc   

### .sort   

* we can use DSU(decorate sort undecorate)   

* immutable   

## random   

### random.random()   

* returns value between 0 and 1   

### random.randint(start, end)   

* gives out integer value between start and end   

### choice   

* we pass list to choice function and it returns one element from it according to the choice   

### pseudorandom   

* sequence of number which appear to be random but generated by deterministic algorithm   

## built-in   

### classes   

* int   

* list   

* tuple   

* dict   

* set   

* functions   

### operator functions   

#### __str__   

* called when str is called on object   

* when passed to print function   

#### __repr__   

* is called when object is useda. when type the obj and press enterb. use the obj in tuple, dict, list etc   

### %   

* eg:'%d %d' % (1,2)   

## metaclass   

### type is metaclass   

* every class is instance of type class   

* type is built-in function too   

## local/global   

### nonlocal   

* used to refer variable defined in parent function   

* used when we have nested functions   

### global   

* used to refer to variable defined in global scope   

## files   

* exception handling   

### anydbm   

* creates database file for key-value pairs   

### pickle   

* is used to convert object to string and back   

### pipe   

* is pointer to object which contains output of recently executed shell command   

## language features   

### wheel   

* new standard for package format   

* replacement for egg   

### package distribution   

#### pip   

* wrapper over distutil which has python package index(library) for searching and downloading packages and than installing   

* internally uses setup.py to install packages   

##### has option -e which install package from project directory rather than internet   

* uses egg-link to specify path to project directory   

#### distutil   

* uses setup.py
