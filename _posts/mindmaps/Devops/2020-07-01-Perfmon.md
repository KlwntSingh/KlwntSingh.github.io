## counters   

### hyper-v   

#### logical processors   

* always constant   

#### Virtual processor   

* based on number of machines running at time   

#### hypervisor startup cost   

* constant   

### hyperv ide controller   

* hard disk controller for virtual machines   

### logical disk   

#### queue lenth   

* tells us how busy it is to access disk   

* other counters here are statistics counters   

### network   

* all the counters here are statistics counters   

### memory   

* committed bytes   

* available bytes   

### paging file   

* % usage   

### processor information   

* % processor time   

* % processor utility   

## measuring disk performance   

* I/O wait
