## dhcp relay agent 
* forwards request from internal network to dhcp server outside of network 
* normally router blocks the broadcast packet but if dhcp relay agent is enabled than it forward the packet to outside network 

## ports used 
* 68 used by client 
* 67 is used by dhcp server 
* they are udp based protocol 

## difference 
* #### gratitious arp 
	* not used to get ip address but to check if the ip is used by any other host 
	* sometimes used by host to refresh mac for ip address on other machines 
* #### rarp 
	* classfull ip address assignment 
* #### bootp 
	* classless ip address assignment 
	* static and manual 
* #### dhcp 
	* dynamic ip address assignment to hosts
