 # DNS  
 ## TCP   
 * For zone transfer   
 ## UDP   
 *  #### for dns request and replies   
  
 	* connection establishment is not required for server to asner the dns request   
 ## root name servers   
 * there are 13 root name servers   
 * They contain information about top level domains like com, org, net etc.   
 * If one root server does not have information about required domain, than request is sent to another root server   
 ## Hostnames, subdomains   
 * safesearch.google.com etc   
 ## Second level domains   
 * eg:- google, cisco   
 ## top level domains   
 * arpa   
 * 3 character domains   
 * 2 character domain   
 ## domain   
 * domain represent full subtree below the node   
 ## zone   
 * subtree which is administered separately   
 * a zone has primary name server and secondary name server   
 * multiple zone can exists on server   
 ## iterative process   
 * when host queries name server for domain, if it does not have any info for domain name, it contacts root name server than root name server replies with ip address of name server.   
 * when dns server receives any information from another server, it caches it   
 ## recursive query   
 * It tells root server to handle the query itself rather than returning list of name servers to query as in case of iterative process   
 ## flags   
 * QR - 1 bit   
 * opcode - 4 bit   
 * AA - 1 bit   
 * TC - 1 bit   
 * RD - 1 bit   
 * RA - 1 bit   
 * unused - 3 bit   
 * rcode - 4 bit   
 ## resource records type   
 *  #### A record   
  
 	* domain name to ip   
 *  #### NS record   
  
 	* Subtopic 1   
 * Cname   
 *  #### PTR   
  
 	* reverse DNS   
 	* ip address to domain name   
 * total no of resource records 20
