 # IPV6  
 ## What?   
 * no broadcast   
 *  #### stateless autoconfiguration   
  
 	* host automatically configure themselves with ip address and access outside internet. Actually router send address prefix and gateway and rest address is generated automatically by host   
 *  #### renumbering   
  
 	* just prefix is replaced with new prefix   
 *  #### no pat/nat   
  
 	* as every address is public address   
 * ipsec is builtin   
 ## terms   
 *  #### prefix   
  
 	* same as network address in ipv4, we replace host part with zeroes   
 *  #### prefix length   
  
 	* subnet mask in ipv4   
 *  #### block   
  
 	* 4 hexadecimal characters together   
 ## shortening   
 * block's of zero can be replace with nothing. Can be done only once   
 * block of zero can be replaced with zero   
 * leading zeroes can be removed   
 ## Prefix calculation(pdf 66)   
 * if prefix length is divisible by 16, whole block can know   
 * if prefix is divisible by 4, than couple of hexadecimal character from block can be known   
 * if not divisible, than convert the block of nth bit to binary and count of no of bit in block to make total of n bit.   
 ## Adressing   
 *  #### global unicast   
  
 	* public address   
 	* we can give this address on any device on network   
 *  #### unicast address   
  
 	* unique local   
 		* same as private address   
 			* 8 bits of prefix is FD::/8or FC::/7 + least significant bit is always 1   
 			* 40 bits of global id   
 			* 16 bits of subnet id   
 			* 64 bits of host id   
 	* link local   
 		* new concept in ipv6 and as name implies works only on local links. They are used to send and recieve packets in subnet   
 		* we use link local addresses for neighbor discovery and next hop address for routing   
 		* starts from FE80::/10   
 		* next 54 bits are set to 0 and rest of 64 bits are decided by host   
 *  #### loopback address   
  
 	* 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1   
 	* it should never be assigned on any physical interface   
 *  #### unspecified address   
  
 	* 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0::   
 	* is not configured on any of host, and is used to indicate host does not have any address   
 *  #### multicast   
  
 	* used by routing protocols   
 	* we use FF::/8 for multicast traffic   
 	* 8 bit(prefix) + 4 bit(flags) + 4 bit(scope) + 112 bit(group id)   
 *  #### anycast   
  
 	* new concept in ipv6.   
 	* multiple devices having same address, and closest interface will recieve the packet destined for anycast address   
 	* It does not have any specific prefix. any unicast address when assigned on multiple devices can be anycast.   
 * public   
 * private   
 * no broadcast   
 ## prefix Assignment   
 * IANA   
 *  #### RIR's   
  
 	* receives /23 prefix   
 *  #### Service Provider   
  
 	* receives /32 prefix   
 *  #### customer   
  
 	* receives /48 prefix   
 	* is called global routing prefix or site prefix   
 	* 64 bits are used as interface address hence 16 bits are left for subnet   
 ## DHCPv6   
 *  #### statefull   
  
 	* works same as dhcp in ipv4   
 * stateless   
 ## fields   
 *  #### ip version   
  
 	* 4 bit   
 *  #### traffic class   
  
 	* 4 bit   
 *  #### flow label   
  
 	* 3 byte   
 *  #### packet length   
  
 	* 2 byte   
 *  #### next header   
  
 	* 1 byte   
 *  #### hop limit   
  
 	* 1 byte   
 *  #### source address   
  
 	* 16 byte   
 *  #### destination address   
  
 	* 16 byte
