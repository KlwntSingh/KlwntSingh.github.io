# LAN

## Ethernet(802.3) 
* Protocolconnectorscables(UTP) 
* #### Notes 
	* Different Physical Layer standards(Cables and connectors) with same data link layer standard(Ethernet frame) 
* #### Physical Layer 
	* Cables 
		* UTP 
			* There are 8 wires coupled together to make 4 pairs of 2 wires each 
				* 10BASE-T100BASE-T 
					* Only two pairs are used i.e 4 wires 
						* 2 transmit 
							* router/access point/computers/printers 
								* pin 1,2 
							* Switches 
								* pin 3, 6 
						* 2 receive 
				* 1000BASE-T 
					* uses all 4 pairs 
						* each pair can transmit and receive 
			* Max distance 100m 
			* Electromagnetic interference also called as crosstalk 
		* Fibre 
* #### Data Link Layer 
	* Same frame format for all different Physical layer standards 
		* Preamble 
			* 7 byte for synchonisation 
		* SFD 
			* start frame delimiter1 byte 
				* Tell about end of preamble and start of ethernet frame 
		* Type 
			* 2 byte 
		* Destination and source 
			* 6 bytes 
				* 24 bits 
					* OUI(Organizationally Unique Identifier) 
					* Vendor Assigned 
			* Unicast/Mulitcast 
			* Broadcast 
				* FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF 
		* FCS 
			* 4 byte 

## Wireless(802.11) 
* #### SOHO Routers 
	* components 
		* router 
		* switch 
		* access point 
		* cable/dsl modem 
	* also called as Autonomous Access Points 
* #### Enterprise Routers 
	* components 
		* Light weight access point(LWAP) 
			* only does traffic forwarding 
		* Wireless LAN Controller(WLC) 
			* Does management meaning creating new network, roaming and authentication of networks 
		* Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points(CAWAP) 
			* tunnel connection between LWAP and WLC 

## components 
* routers 
* access points 
* switches 

## Switch 
* #### Vlan 
	* divides network or divides switch to different networks 
		* divisions having same ip range makes no sense 
		* same division having two networks also make no sense, packet from host will always go to gateway of same network 
	* Ideally one to one mapping of vlan and network address 
	* defines broadcast domain 
* In cam table, Multiple mac address can exist on same port 

## Router 
* Same networks cannot be on two interfaces 

## Duplex 
* #### Switch 
	* CSMA/CD is not required 
* #### Hub 
	* just like repeater with multiple ports 
* #### Network Duplexity 
	* Hub is made half duplex using CSMA/CD 
	* Switch operate in full duplex, because a. it smart as only transfer data to required host b. hold frames in memory in case more frames need to travel through interface 
* #### Medium Duplexity 
	* UTP is full duplex by default as 2 pair for transmit and 2 pair for receive 
	* 10BASE-2 - coaxial cable is half-duplex 
* #### CSMA/CD 
	* Carrier Sense 
		* devices can sense if cable is being used 
	* multple devices can access cable 
	* Collision Detection 
		* if collision is detected, and than jamming signal is sent to all devices to tell not to send anything.than after random time, data is sent
