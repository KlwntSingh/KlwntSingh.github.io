# Nat  

## Napt   

* nat i.e pat   

* network address port translation   

## for icmp packet   

* uses identifier in icmp header to map private ip addres to public ip address   

### what happens icmp identifier equals any process port number?   

* they use protocol field of ip header too in nat table in router   

## nat traversal   

* used when ipsec tunnel goes from nat device, ipsec header packet is encapuslated in udp port 4500 for esp and 500 for isakmp   

## how does nat performs for fragmented ip packet   

* nat table also remember ip identifier field in ip header because every packet will not contain port no.   

## types   

### static   

* 1 to 1   

### dynamic   

* many to pool   

* many to one   

## session   

### start of session   

* direction os first flow of packet creates the session   

### end of session   

* ending of session is important because if session is not ended and public ip address is not released than it cannot be used by another session   

* This is important incase of dynamic   

* session represent set of traffic that is managed as a unit of translation   

## natt session remembers   

* source ip   

### protocol no in ip header   

* for mapping icmp to icmp rather icmp to tcp because icmp identifier field might have same port no   

### ip header identifier field   

* for fragmented data   

* source port no
