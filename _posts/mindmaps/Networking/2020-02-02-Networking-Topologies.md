# Networking Topologies  

## Star Topology   

* one central device from where all traffic is crossed   

* provides mesh toplogy as logical topolgy   

## Hub/Spoke Topology   

* device through which traffic is routed is hub and other nodes are called spoke   

* Central device which connects hub and spokes follow start topology   

* logical topology over start topology as physical toplogy   

## Mesh   

* everything is connected to everything   

## Partial Mesh   

* some  nodes are connected to everything   

* other nodes are connected to nodes whcih are connected to every things   

* Hybrid
