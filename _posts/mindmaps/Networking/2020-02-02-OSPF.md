# OSPF  

## Steps   

### one paradigm   

#### Hello Packet for neigbhor discovery   

##### Scope of area is defined by following fields   

* area   

###### authentication   
where   

* per interface   
entire area/domain   
key cannot be given in area. Key has to be given per interface. Reason for this is that every interface on router can have different key for same area.   

* Two different keys cannot be given to interface   
types   
plain text   

* aut:1   

* can be done per interface and entire domain/area   
md5   
aut:2   

* can be done per interface and entire domain/area   
HMAC-SHA(Hash Message Authentication Code - Secure Hash Algorithm)   

* can be done per interface only   

* configured using key chain just like rip/eigrp   

* we have to select cryptographic algorithm too with key   

* area flag   

###### why router-id and process-id not part of it?   

* router-id is unique identifier of routers and not domain/area   

* process-id has local significance and not domain/area significance   

###### timers   

* hello timers   

* dead timers   

#### LSA advertisements for LSDB(link state advertisement database)   

* Also called as map in real world analogy   

#### (SPF)Shortest Path First algorithm over lsdb to populate route table   

* navigation system in real world topology   

### second paradigm   

* links   

#### neighbors(physical)   

* hello packets exchanged and parameters matched   

#### adjacencies(built)   

* neighbor go on to form adjacencies when lsdb's match   

* neighbor and adjacencies are same in normal network types.but in case of NBMA and broadcast, only DR and BDR is adjacent   

## Points   

### Areas   

* All the area are connected together through area 0   

* Traffic from 1 area to another area has to go through area 0   

* inter - means different areaIntra - means same area   

* Area can number of networks inside   

### Link State Routing Protocol   

* advertises state of every link(interfaces) to all   

### DR and BDR   

* In mesh of routers,Rather than sending LSA's to every other router and increasing LSA traffic on network, we can use DR(Designated Router) and BDR(Backup Designated Router) .Routers Only have to send LSA's to DR   

* Selection of DR and BDR is per multi-access segment(subnet) and not area   

#### selection process   

##### priority   

* if priority is set 0, than router will not take part in DR/BDR election   

* highest routerId   

### Cost   

#### Minimum is better   

##### Reference Bandwidth   

* OSPF calculates cost using reference bandwidth and dividing interface bandwidth with it   

* By default, it is 100Mbps, so in case of gigabit interface, cost will be 1(as min can be 1).cost will be 1 for FastEthernet. Hence, to avoid this issue we change reference bandwidth   

* If two path have same cost, than both will be used and loadbalancing will occur   

### Default Route   

* If one of router is connected to internet, we can enable default route on that and it will be transferred to every other router   

#### There are couple of options on defining default route   

* one option is always, default route will be advertised even when we dont have default route in routing table. becuase other wise if we dont have default route than there will be no advertisement   

### Loopback interface   

* Like everyother interface, loopback can be reachable if advertised using LSA   

* It has cost of 1 by default   

### Why Multiple areas   

* Because each area will have small LSDB hence Shortest path algorithm will take less time to run   

### OSPF TTL Security check   

* prevents attacker overloading control plan of router running ospf   

* makes router to accept packet with ttl val 255 by default hence dropping packets with value less than 255   

* By default, ttl value when no security check is enabled is 1   

* range of ttl values can be used using hop option   

### Router Id   

* router id selection is done only once i.e when process starts. To change router-id you have restart process   

* When manually setting router-id, it will reflected immediately without reset process only when no neighours are present   

#### selection process   

* manual   

* highest loopback addr   

* highest physical interface addr   

### virtual links   

* area 0 is divided into two area's, we use virtual link to combine those   

* non-backbone are not directly connected to backbone area   

### working of network command   

* first with network command, we select all the interfaces inside this network which should advertise ospf advertisements   

* than those network are advertised, which are assigned to interface   

* Only LSA's are flooded, hellow packets are senet only to neighbors   

### restrictions   

* every area must be connected with area 0   

* area 0 cannot be split into 2   

## Basic   

* Protocol above network layer. Does not uses transport or udp layer protocol. Protocol number is 89   

* Multicast address 224.0.0.5224.0.0.6   

## troubleshooting   

* check if multicast traffic is blocked   

## benefits over distance vector   

### fast convergence   

* because of area hierarchy   

### scalability   

* only updates are sent   

## Doubts   

### process id combines two areas   

* no, process id has local significance on router   

* different process id makes different LSDB   

# Working  

## Packet Types   

### HELLO   

* neighbor discovery and building neighbor adjacency   

### DBD   

* To check if two routers have same lsdb or not   

### LSR   

* requesting specific link-state records from adjacent routers   

### LSU   

* send specific link-state records that were requested   

### LSACK   

* acknowledge other because ospf is reliable protocol   

## LSA types   

### type 1(router)   

* sending LSA1 to adjacent routers on every interface for respective area   

### type 2(network)   

* sending LSA2 from DR to DROther for respective area on multicast add 224.0.0.5   

* LSA1 are sent from DROther to DR on multicast addr 224.0.0.6.If IGMP snooping is on switch, than switch will forward the packet only to DR   

### type 3(Summary)   

* ABR routers send type 3 LSA from one area to another area   

### type 4(Summary ASBR)   

* ABR send type 4 LSA to tell everybody in area 0 about location of ASBR in non-backbone area   

### type 5(External LSA)   

#### LSA generated by ASBR regarding external network   

##### two types of cost   

###### E1   

* cost to reach ASBR + cost of destination from ASBR   

###### E2(Default)   

* cost to destination from ASBR, internal cost to reach ASBR is rejected   

* type 6(Multicast)   

### type 7(NSSA LSA   

* Alternate of type 5 LSA for NSSA area. This LSA is converted to type 5 by ABR   

* ASBR in stub area hence, lsa7 are generated by asbr about external routes, and this lsa7 is converted lsa5 when reaching ABR   

### total 11 lsa's   

#### lsa 8   

* used to carry information about external attributes   

* eg:- used to carry bgp attributes but route about destination network are carried by lsa 5   

#### lsa 9, 10, 11   

* they are used to carry parameter which ospf don't care about.for eg: In mpls they are used to carry information about maximum bandwidth, unreserved bandwidth etc   

## states   

### Down   

* hello packet has not been received from neighbors but hello packets can be sent   

* if 2 way state router does not receive hello packet in deadInterval, it moves to down state   

### attempt   

* state valid only for NBMA   

* router sends poll hello packet to neighbor from where hello packets have not been received withing dead interval   

### init   

* hello packet was received from neighboring router but receiving router-id was not present received hello packet.when router receives hello packet, it should not down the received packet source router-id to be used in advertised hello packets   

### two way state   

* this state tells that bidirectional communication has been established   

* DR/BDR election happens in state for broadcast, non-broadcast multi-access networks   

### ex-start   

* This is state where actual link-state information exchange starts   

* on per-neighbor basis, master slave election process happens. and master is the only one to increase the sequence number   

### exchange   

* In this state, database-descriptors(DBD) are exchanged.Database descriptors contain LSA headers which tells the whole information present in Link State database.   

### loading   

* In this state, actual link state database exchange occurs   

* based on DBD, routers send link state request packets.   

### full   

* In this state, router are fully adjacent to each other   

* full is reached only with  DR/BDR in NBMA networks   

## Network Types   

### Point to POint   

* router connected directly to another router   

### Point to multipoint   

* router connected to each other like hub-spoke technology   

* No DR?BDR election required   

### NBMA   

* DR/BDR election requied   

* eg: frame relay network   

### broadcast   

* DR/BDR election required   

* eg: ethernet   

## tables   

* neighbors   

* Link state database/ Topology database   

* routing table   

## packets   

### Packet Types/Message types   

#### Hello packets   

##### for adjacency to build, following fields in hello packets should match   

* hello timer   

###### dead interval timer   

* 4* hello timer   

* options   

* authentication   

* subnet mask   

* area id   

* contains list of headers   

* default time 10sec   

#### Database Description Packets   

* list of LSA headers   

* Link State Request Packets   

#### Link State Update packets   

* contains LSA + LS data   

#### Link State Acknowledgement   

* sent for every LSU packets   

* for reliable communication of LSU   

### common headers   

* area Id   

* Authentication   

* length   

#### checksum   

* whole packet except for authentication fields   

* version   

* router id   

### LSA(Link State Advertisements)   

* contains list of links and it's stat   

#### uniquely identified by   

* type   

* link state id   

* advertising router id   

* also has length field   

## Types of Router   

### ABR(Area Border Router)   

* Router combining two different area   

* can have multiple LSDB's per area   

* summary routes are injected directly into routing table   

### ASBR(Autonomous System Border Router)   

* Router connected to network with different routing protocol   

### Backbone Router   

* Routers inside backbone or area 0   

## areas   

* area 0backbone area   

### stub area   

* don't allow lsa type 5   

### totally stub area   

* don't allow lsa 3, 4, 5   

### not so stubby area   

* don't allow lsa 3, 4, 5 but 7(which is same as 5)   

## Flow of building router adjacency   

* Down State   

* router will send hello packet with multicast address 224.0.0.5   

* other router will receive packet and put sending router into adjacent list   

* changes to init state   

* receiving router will respond with unicast address and neighbor field will include all the neighbor including sending router   

* router will see the response and see it's own router-id   

* two-way state   

### exstart state   

* we select master and slave. router with highest router-id is selected as master   

### exchange state   

* two routers sending DBD with summary of LSDB   

* Couple of things happen here. if new information is present in lsdb, than router send LSR   

* Loading State   

* The requested will send LSU and requester will send LSACK on receiving LSU   

* Full statte
