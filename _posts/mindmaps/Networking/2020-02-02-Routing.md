# Routing  

## hardware   

### aux port   

* can connect modem with it   

* output is pushed after power up   

### console port   

* output is pushed during power up and post   

### wic cards   

* additional cards to extend functionality of routers   

## interface configuration columns   

### ip addresss   

* ip address assigned to interface   

### ok   

* if interface is performing correctly or not   

### method   

* method used for configuring ip address   

* manual   

* automatic   

### status   

#### if interface is active/up or not   

* administratively down means interface has shutdown command   

### protocol   

* if protocol configured on interface is working or not   

## commands   

* show interface NameNumber   

### sh controllers serial Number   

* to check if router is dce or dte   

## interfaces   

* gigabit ethernet   

* fast ethernet   

### serial   

#### DCEData communications equipment   

* Clockrate is required here   

* DTEData terminal equipment   

## Why Ip address were required?   

* Because Mac Adress are not hierarichal structure i.e if we were only using mac address, then to communicate on internet we need to know mac address of every system we want to communicate.   

* but Since ip address are hierarichal, we only need to configure the single network address for range of system   

## Questions   

* which is choosed as default gateway when two network interfaces cards with different networks are attached to computer   

## Routing Table   

* When there is conflict i.e multiple routes matches destination ip address, then most specific route will be used   

### flags   

#### H   

* destination host i.e subnet mask is 32   

#### G   

* gateway   

* means destination network is not directly connected   

#### D   

##### icmp redirect   

* not entertained by routers?   

#### U   

* route is up   

### is changed by following   

* manual while defining static routes   

* automatically by router daemons   

#### icmp redirect   

* icmp redirects are only used by host and not routers because it can be abused as hacking attack to change route for router   

## Static Routes   

### If administrative distance is specified while creating static route than we define floating static routes   

* it is used when dynamic learned route dissapears   

* administrative distance is 1 by default   

### when giving static route, it is recommended to give both outgoing interface and next hop ip address for ethernet link and only outgoing interface for serial links   

* There is blog written on by cisco what could be possible issue when not doing sohttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/dial-access/floating-static-route/118263-technote-nexthop-00.html   

* if there is no outgoing interface, but only next hop ip address is specified, than recursive lookup on next hop can help untill outgoing interface is found   

#### if only outgoing interface is given and not the next hop ip address, now this can work in case of serial interface but incase of ethernet, we don't have way to find mac address using arp   

* in case of directly connected networks, we don't have next hop ip address because next hop ip address will be the address we are trying to use   

* worst case: In case it is broadcast static route on outgoing interface, every destination ip address will be considred as next hop ip address and arp request will be fired for every destionation ip. Hence it is computatively intensive and also arp cache failures   

* Static routes are recursive, that to resolve the next hop ip address, routing table might be accessed again   

* route which considers   

## Ip Routing   

### Steps   

#### when frame arrives on router, It will check if FCS is correct or not   

* if fcs is not correct, frame will be dropped right away   

* Also, there is no recovery mechanism for ethernet   

#### check the destination mac address matches   

* mac address of arriving interface   

* mac address of broadcast domain for subnet   

* mac address for multicast domain   

* will extract packet from ethernet frame and discard the frame   

#### Now, Header checksum for ip packet will checked   

* if it is not correct, than packet will be discarded right away   

* There is no recovery mechanism in ip layer   

* destination ip address is checked in routing table, Search for corresponding outgoing interface and next hop ip address   

* after address is found, ttl is decremented and header checksum is calculated. packet is sent to 2nd layer   

* if destination mac address is found in arp table, than it is used otherwise arp is used to find mac address   

## Routing table entry   

* network address   

* subnet mask   

### metric   

* can be considered as cost   

### administrative distance   

* can be considered as weight   

* outgoing interface   

### next hop ip address   

* next hop address is only used to find mac address to next coming router   

## special addresses   

### this host   

* all zero bits   

### specific host on this net   

* network bit all zero, host bits not zero.   

### limited broadcast   

* all bits of address are one   

### net directed   

* network bits tell about network, host bits are ones   

### subnet directed   

* network and subnet bits are not one, host bits are ones   

### all subnet directed   

* subnet bits and host bits are one but network bits are not one.   

# Routing Protocols  

## Distance Vector   

* distance means - metric   

* vector means direction(outgoing interface)   

### RIP [anchor](xmind:#1a617pjtkuq5sf9fpfk8j0eh5k "anchor")  

#### Metric used is hop count   

* max metric  value is 16   

* Every 30 seconds routing update is sent   

#### split horizon technique is used   

* hence counting to infinity problem is solved   

* not sending updates on same interface where got update about network   

#### Whenever there is change in route, triggered update is sent with change   

* sending triggered update for route which is down is called route poisoning   

#### After other routers know that particular route is down, they start holddown timer for 180 secs   

* after time elapsed, we remove the entry from routing table   

* if we get routing update with worst metric, we ignore it   

* If we get routing update with better metric, we use it to update routing table   

#### Comparison of version 1 and 2   

##### version 1   

###### classfull.Routing update does not have information about classes. Traditional ip ranges used to know subnet mask   
Broadcast   
no support for manual sumaries   

* no authentication   

##### version 2   

###### Classless   
multicast224.0.0.9   
support for manual summaries   

* authentication   

#### Summarization   

##### no auto-summary in version 2 means to enable classless and hence subnet mask will be sent in updates which was used when assigning ip address to interface   

* eg:- if class b network, subnet mask will also be sent which can be 255.255.255.0   

#### explanation of sh ip route row   

##### R 92.168.23.0/24 [120/1] via 192.168.12.2, 00:00:16, FastEthernet1/0   

* R - rip   

* 192.168.23.0 - destionation network   

###### 120/1   

* administrative distance - 120   

* metric - 1(hop count)   

###### via 192.168.12.2   

* next hop ip address   

###### 00:00:16   

* time since we received update   

###### FastEthernet1/0   

* outgoing interface   

#### multiple paths to same network with same metric, than load balancing will occur   

##### number of path on which load can be balanced can be changed using maximum-path options   

* by default maximum path is 4   

* In case maximum-path is 1, we are disabling load balancing and also it will choose the path which was installed first in routing path   

#### command   

##### command network 192.168.0.0   
In comments, This point is said as mistake  
  

* it will work with subnet 255.255.0.0 because zero is used   

##### command network 172.16.1.0   

* it will also work with subnet 255.255.0.0 as it is class B ip address   

#### passive interface   

* passive interface is still advertised in rip packet but no rip packet is sent on passive interface   

##### command   

###### passive-interface default   

* it will make every interface passive interface and to send rip packets on interface we have explicitly make it no passive-interface   

#### default route   

##### command   

###### default-information originate   

* It will advertise static default route configured on router   

#### Troubleshoot   

##### commands   

###### sh ip rip database   

* shows network which are to be advertised   

###### sh ip route rip   

* sh routing table learned using rip   

###### sh ip protocols   

* sh all the running ip protocols   

###### debug ip rip   

* sh debug info about rip   

##### Points   

###### network command   

* sh ip protocols   

* sh run | sec rip   

###### check if interface is down   

* sh ip int br   

###### passive interface   

* sh ip protocols   

###### version mismatch   

* sh ip protocols   

###### hop count   

* debug ip rip   

* disable offset list   

###### authentication problem   

* debug ip rip   

* authentication enabled on one interface and not on interface of directly connected router   

###### filters   

* advertisements are filtered for network it is advertising   

* sh run | sec rip   

* show access-lists NUMBER   

* Route summarization issue   

#### port no. - 520   

* both source and destination port   

#### header   

##### each route is represented by 20 bytes   

* 2 byte address family   

* 2 byte must be zero   

* 4 byte ip address   

* 8 byte must be zero   

###### metric   

* 4 bytes   

##### 4 bytes of generic header   

###### command   

* 1 byte   

###### version   

* 1 byte   

* 2 byte must be zero   

* Total size: 504 bytes(25 20 bytes routes + 4 bytes generic header)   

#### disadvantage of RIP   

* takes long to stabilize   

* does not use subnet mask   

* uses hop count rather than more important parameter i.e bandwidth   

### EIGRP   

* classless   

* protocol no. 88   

## Link State   

### OSPF   

* classless   

* protocol no. 89   

## path vector protocol   

* BGP   

## command   

### sh ip protocols   

* very useful command to know about routing protocol running   

## Administrative Distance   

### Static numbers given to different ways a route is learned   

* 0 for directly connection   

#### 1 for static routes   

* it has metric as 0   

* 90 for eigrp   

* 110 for ospf   

* 120 for rip   

## Floating Static Route   

* when administrative distance of static route is changed from 1 to higher value to change its preference to come after dynamic protocol   

## Route Summarizations   

### advantages   

* saves memory   

#### saves bandwidth   

* network up/down will not have triggered updates as long any network from summarized network range is still available   

* saves cpu cycles   

### disadvantage   

* forwarding packets for unused network   

#### sub optimal routing   

* Routers longest prefix match of network for selecting the path, there is chance that longest prefix match is longest path than summarized network path   

## difference   

### protocols   

#### Periodic update/ triggered update   

* both triggered adn periodic udpate.Triggered update when there is change.periodic update every 30 sec with whole database   

* triggered update and never periodic update.There is sanity check every 30 minutes where every lsa is advertised   

* triggered   

#### change/whole protocol database during triggered update   

* Only change is sent with withdraw request   

* triggered update only send updates.periodic update send the whole table   

* Only changes travel during trigered update   

#### heart beat   

* hello pacets every 10 secs   

* keepalive(60 sec)   

* periodic update is keepalive   

#### neighborship/adjacency/peership   

* In 2-way state, neighborship is achieved   

* adjacency is achieved at full state. adjacency confirms that databases have been synchronised   

* peership is formed after established state as bgp parameters are also verified till now   

* peership does not confirm that databases have been synchronised   

#### versions   

* ospfv2 - ipv4   

* ospfv3 - ipv6   

* bgp version 6   

### Subtopic 2   

#### Subtopic 1   

* decision is based on distance   

* they sent complete routing table to neighbors   

* decision is based on latency, delay and througput   

* information about directly connected link it sent to all the routers in domain   

### timers   

#### stp   

##### hello timer   

* 2 sec   

* max age tiemr   

#### rip   

##### hold down timer   

* 30 sec   

#### ospf   

##### hello timer   

* 10 sec   

* dead interval timer   

#### bgp   

* keepalive   

## points   

* each routing process install the best path into routing table based on it's internal metric.lowest administrative distance and lowest metric are preferred   

* destination with same prefixes are comapred based on lowest administrative sitance.destination with different prefix length are considered different destinations hence very will be installed into routing   

* longest prefix wins among routes actually installed in routing table. lowest administrative distance wins when actually installing the route.   

* here we are talking about installing routing paths into routing table when multiple path comes in single routing protocol or among multiple routing protocols   

# BGP  

## path vector protocol   

* because it carries the AS number of system which it has traversed to loop avoidance   

* uses tcp port 179   

* manually neighbors are configured   

## EGP   

* exterior gateway protocol   

* uses to connect Autonomous system together   

## when and when not to use BGP   

* 1. when your AS is acting as transit AS   

* 1. When you AS is multihomed, means multiple connections to different ISP's than we will BGP for path manipulation to reach internet   

* 1. we will not use BGP if single homed AS2. lack of resources like memory, less processing power in routers.   

## BGP Neighbors   

### IBGP   

#### routes are only advertised to logically connected peers   

* reason is to prevent loops because inside AS, as_path cannot be used to prevent loops as autonomous system number is same   

* EBGP   

## BGP Tables   

### neighbor table   

* list of all neighbors   

### bgp forwarding table   

* all the networks known by bgp with attributes   

* routing table   

## loop prevention mechanism   

### IBGP   

#### split horizon rule   

##### routes are not further advertised which were learned from directly connected router on one interface to another interface of same router   

* to come across this problem, we have to create full mesh of neighbors virtually by establishing tcp connection between every neighbor   

###### Route reflectors   

* one router acts as server and other routers as client   

* there is neighbors ship between client and server and not between any client and clinet   

* we can have two server's two for redundancy   

* we run extra command on server, when configuring router-reflector clients   

* confederation   

### EBGP   

* path variable carries the AS number   

## synchronisation rule   

* (routes will not be used) or (advertised to external neighbor) if routes have not been  learned using IGP too.   

* self next hop   

## next hop address   

### edge router   

#### when route going outside to another AS   

* router will change next hop to itself   

#### when route comming from outside to internal AS   

* next hop will not change by default, hence we will force route to change by using self-next-hop   

### internal router   

#### if router is originator of route   

* than set itself to the next-hop   

#### route reflector   

* does not change next hop   

* latest cisco ios support self next hop on route reflector   

* nice explanation [anchor](https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/08/bgp-next-hop-processing.html "anchor")  

* next hop changes on every hop by hop for ebgp's   

* update source   

## homed   

### single homed   

* one connection, one service provider   

### dual homed   

* multiple connection one service provider   

### multi homed   

* multiple connection, multiple service provider   

## States   

### Idle   

* initiates tcp connection or listen for connection from peers   

#### connectRetryTimer   

* it doubles each time a state goes back to idle   

### connect   

#### initiates tcp handshake   

* if completed, open message is sent and state changes to OpenSent   

* connectRetryTimer is reset   

* if connectRetryTimer timeout before tcp handshake, state changes to Active and connectRetryTimer is reset   

* if any other input is received, state may change to Idle   

### active   

* tcp connection initiated again, if established open message is sent and state changes to openSent. hold timer is set to 4 minutes.   

* if connection fails, state changes to Connect and connectRetryTimer is reset   

### open sent   

#### if open message is sent   

##### sender waits for open message from other side, it matches for following fields received from other side   

* bgp version   

* source ip address of open message should match the ip address configured for neighbor   

* AS number   

* BGP identifier must be unique   

* security parameter   

* if open message matches, hold time is negociated with lowest value and keepalive message is sent. state changes to openconfirm   

#### error in received open message   

* notification is sent and state changes to Idle   

#### tcp disconnect is received   

* bgp closes the connection, connectRetryTimer reset and state changes to Active   

### open confirmed   

#### waits for keepalive or notification   

* on receipt of keepalive, state changes to established   

* if hold timer expires or notification is received, state moves to Idle   

### established   

#### keepalive messages and bgp updates are received   

* holdtimer are reset on both keepalive and update   

* if hold timer expires, notification is generated and state moves to idle   

## multihop   

### why we use multihop option for ebgp peers?   

* because ebgp peership can only be between directly connected neighbors.They use ttl of 1   

## difference   

### IBGP vs EBGP   

#### directly connected   

* logical directly connected links, if physical directly connected links were made than it would have mesh topology   

* physical directly connected links   

#### route advertisements   

* Cannot advertise routes learned from other internal routers.This is loop prevention mechanism because as_path in routes will be same.logical full mesh is required   

* Now, corresponding rule in EBGP that non-bgp router issue restricts bgp to advertise routes, hence no syncronisation is used   

* Can advertise BGP routes learned from another router   

* Reason for directly connected is that if non-bgp router receives packet with destination address wihc is being advetised using bgp protocol, router will drop the packet   

### Subtopic 2   

#### Subtopic 1   

* Subtopic 1   

* Subtopic 2   

## messages   

* open type - 1   

### notification type 3   

* in case of error   

* update type 2   

### keepalive type 4   

* every 60 sec   

## attributes   

### well know(supported)   

* mandatoryused and propagated   

* discretionaryused but not propagation is optional   

* optional transitiveif unsupported, marked as partial   

* optional non-transitiveif unsupproted, it is deleted   

### two things based on which it is categorised   

#### used   

* supported/discretionary   

* mandatory   

#### propagated   

* transitive   

### different attributes   

* AS_PATH   

* origin type   

#### weight   

* cisco proprietary   

* used locally on router to prefer particular route to reach desitnation   

#### local pref   

* Same as weight but it notifies other router's too in AS to prefer particular route to reach destination   

#### multi exit discriminator   

* If autonomous system have multiple path to reach to it. It will be tell other autonomous system, to prefer which path to reach to it   

## status code vs origin code   

### origin type   

#### i   

* means network advertised using network command   

#### e   

* not used not   

#### ?   

* route is distributed into bgp   

### status code   

#### i   

* internal route   

* not used for directly connected route   

## versions   

### bgp-4   

* deals with ipv4 adddress family   

### mp-bgp   

#### handle additional address family   

* vpn labels   

* ipv6 address   

#### uses AFI and SAFI   

* AFI: address family identifier   

* SAFI: Subsequent address family identifier   

# RIP  

## Metric used is hop count   

* max metric  value is 16   

* Every 30 seconds routing update is sent   

## split horizon technique is used   

* hence counting to infinity problem is solved   

* not sending updates on same interface where got update about network   

## Whenever there is change in route, triggered update is sent with change   

* sending triggered update for route which is down is called route poisoning

* after time elapsed, we remove the entry from routing table   

* if we get routing update with worst metric, we ignore it   

* If we get routing update with better metric, we use it to update routing table   

## Comparison of version 1 and 2   

### version 1   

#### classfull.Routing update does not have information about classes. Traditional ip ranges used to know subnet mask   

##### Broadcast   

###### no support for manual sumaries   

* no authentication   

### version 2   

#### Classless   

##### multicast224.0.0.9   

###### support for manual summaries   

* authentication   

## Summarization   

### no auto-summary in version 2 means to enable classless and hence subnet mask will be sent in updates which was used when assigning ip address to interface   

* eg:- if class b network, subnet mask will also be sent which can be 255.255.255.0

## multiple paths to same network with same metric, than load balancing will occur   

### number of path on which load can be balanced can be changed using maximum-path options   

* by default maximum path is 4   

* In case maximum-path is 1, we are disabling load balancing and also it will choose the path which was installed first in routing path   

## command   

### command network 192.168.0.0   
In comments, This point is said as mistake  
  

* it will work with subnet 255.255.0.0 because zero is used   

### command network 172.16.1.0   

* it will also work with subnet 255.255.0.0 as it is class B ip address   

## passive interface   

* passive interface is still advertised in rip packet but no rip packet is sent on passive interface   

### command   

#### passive-interface default   

* it will make every interface passive interface and to send rip packets on interface we have explicitly make it no passive-interface   

## default route   

### command   

#### default-information originate   

* It will advertise static default route configured on router   

## Troubleshoot   

### commands   

#### sh ip rip database   

* shows network which are to be advertised   

#### sh ip route rip   

* sh routing table learned using rip   

#### sh ip protocols   

* sh all the running ip protocols   

#### debug ip rip   

* sh debug info about rip   

### Points   

#### network command   

* sh ip protocols   

* sh run | sec rip   

#### check if interface is down   

* sh ip int br   

#### passive interface   

* sh ip protocols   

#### version mismatch   

* sh ip protocols   

#### hop count   

* debug ip rip   

* disable offset list   

#### authentication problem   

* debug ip rip   

* authentication enabled on one interface and not on interface of directly connected router   

#### filters   

* advertisements are filtered for network it is advertising   

* sh run | sec rip   

* show access-lists NUMBER   

* Route summarization issue   

## port no. - 520   

* both source and destination port   

## header   

### each route is represented by 20 bytes   

* 2 byte address family   

* 2 byte must be zero   

* 4 byte ip address   

* 8 byte must be zero   

#### metric   

* 4 bytes   

### 4 bytes of generic header   

#### command   

* 1 byte   

#### version   

* 1 byte   

* 2 byte must be zero   

* Total size: 504 bytes(25 20 bytes routes + 4 bytes generic header)   

## disadvantage of RIP   

* takes long to stabilize   

* does not use subnet mask   

* uses hop count rather than more important parameter i.e bandwidth   

## timers   

### hello timers / update timers   

* every 30 sec update is sent   

### invalid timer   

* if no hello update is received for 180 sec, route is invalidated by putting metric as 16.After metric is updated, it send triggered update   

### hold down timer   

* after sending triggered update, rip waits another 180 sec.   

### flush timer   

* after hold down timer expires, it waits additional of 60 secs and removes the routes from routeing table
