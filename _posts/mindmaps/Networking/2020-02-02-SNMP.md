# SNMP

## MIB 
* management information base 
* database which keeps record for every management metric or objects 
* It is tree of objects which can read or written for particular device 
* #### two types of objects 
	* scalar 
		* single instance of object in tree 
	* tabular 
		* multiple instance of object 

## OID 
* object identifier 
* it specifies any object in MIB tree 
* used to represent object in tree or table 
* it starts from top to down the tree 

## components 
* #### SNMP Mananer 
	* used get request to fetch detail from snmp agent 
* #### SNMP Agent 
	* community profile 
		* read-only 
		* read-write 

## different versions 
* #### version 1 
	* uses community string for authentication 
	* messages 
		* get-request 
		* get-next-request 
		* set-request 
		* get-response 
		* trap 
* #### version 2 
	* uses community string for authentication 
	* message types 
		* get-request 
		* get-next-request 
		* set-request 
		* get-response / response 
		* trap 
		* get-bulk-request 
		* inform-request 
			* fix over trap message because trap message can be lost, it ensures delivery of message by using acknowledgements 
* #### version 3 
	* improved security featurs 
		* authentication 
		* privacy 
		* access control 
	* Report message type was introduced 

## udp based portocol and uses ports 
* #### 161 
	* when manager polls the agent station 
* #### 162 
	* when agent send traps to manager 

## analogy of SNMP object with programming language variable 
* variable - object 
* variable name - object identifier 
* variable type - object type 
* value - object instance 
* language - ASN.1(Abstract syntax notation one) 
* compiler - BER 

## ASN 
* a notation that describes the rule and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting and decoding data 

## framework 
* #### SMI 
	* building blocks for managed object construction 
	* three parts 
		* module definitions 
			* MODULE-IDENTITY 
		* object definitions 
			* OBJECT-TYPE 
		* notification definitions 
			* NOTIFICATION-TYPE 
* #### MIB 
	* collection of SMI forms MIB 
* SNMP 
* SNMP Security and authentication 

## SNMP system 
* #### device types 
	* managed nodes 
		* agent 
		* MIB 
	* network management stations 
		* manager 
		* applications 

## packet 
* #### snmp version 
	* version 1 is represented by 0 
* #### snmp community string 
	* string of octets 
* #### snmp pdu 
	* request id 
	* error 
		* 0x00 used when sending request 
		* code is kept in response according to type of error occurs 
	* error index 
	* varbind list 
		* varbind 
			* object identifier 
			* value 
# RMON

## it provides historical data too 

## versions 
* #### v1 
	* works on lower 2 layers i.e physical and data link layer 
* #### v2 
	* works on network layer and above 
# syslog

## can use both udp and tcp 

## port no is 123 

## used by agent to send events to logging server 

## format 
* seq no.:timestamp:%facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description 
# NETFLOW

## cisco proprietary 

## collect IP network traffic as it enters and exits an interface 

## components 
* flow exporter 
* flow collector 
* analysis application
