# WAN

## owner 
* phone/cable companies 
* service provicers 
* satelite companies 

## Lan 
* ethernet is procotol used 
* wireless 

## protocols 

## Layers 
* they operate on layer 1 and layer 2 
* #### layer 1 
	* cables 
	* connectors 
	* interfaces 
	* hardware 
* layer 2 

## Physical Layer TerminologyDifferent devices 
* #### Customer Premises 
	* CSU/DSU/DTE 
		* router/DTE 
* #### Service Provider Premises 
	* CO 
		* WAN 

## WAN forwarding Technologies 
* #### Circuit Switching 
	* Drawback:-waste of resources even when there is no traffic. 
	* egs: 
		* pots 
		* isdn 
		* pstn 
* #### Packet Switching 
	* eg: 
		* internet 
* #### Cell Switching 
	* size of frame is fixed 
		* 53 bytes in case of ATM 
	* eg: 
		* atm 

## Wan Technologies 
* #### Leased Line 
	* point to point link with dedicated network 
	* serial link 
	* leased circuit 
	* provided by phone companies 
		* we know them by E1/T1/T3/E3 
		* speedds 
			* DS0 
				* 64kbps 
			* T1(DS1) 
				* 1.54Mbps 
			* T3(DS3) 
				* 43.736Mbps 
			* E0 
				* 64Kbps 
			* E1 
				* 2.048Mbps 
			* E3 
				* 34.368Mbps 
	* Physical 
		* Serial Cable with DCE and DTE connectors 
	* Data Link Layer 
		* PPP 
			* authentication 
				* PAP 
					* Password Authentication protocol 
						* password sent in plain text 
				* CHAP 
					* challenge Authentication protocol 
						* more secure as password is not send in plain text 
			* operates at data link layer 2 
				* LCP 
					* Link Control Protocol 
					* It will take care of authentication 
				* NCP 
					* Network Control Protocol 
			* It operates over serial links but make it work over ethernet they developed new protocol 
				* ppoe 
			* Multiple PPP 
				* It helps in load balancing the traffic 
		* HDLC 
			* default for serial interfaces 
			* every vendor have their own implementation of hdlc which makes incompatible between vendors 
* #### Frame Relay 
	* point to point or point to multipoint with shared network 
	* packet switched. It created virtual private circuit for it's user. appeared to be dedicated circuit to it's users 
	* defines layer 1 and layer 2 
	* has it's basis in x.25(popular in 1980) packet switching 
		* x.25 worked over analog lines with high transmission error 
	* traditionally designed to work over ISDN. It works over analog lines with less transmission errors 
		* basically, it is packet switched over circuit switched technology 
	* uses frames of variable sizes 
* #### DSL 
	* Components 
		* DSLAM 
			* Service Provider side device to divide voice and data traffic 
		* Splitter 
			* Customer Side device to divide voice and data traffic 
		* DSL Modem 
		* Cables 
			* RJ11 
				* connection between splitter and phone and DSL modem 
			* phone lines 
				* connection between splitter and DSLAM 
	* It is based on already laid phone lines 
* #### Cable 
	* componenets 
		* Cable Modem 
		* Splitter 
		* Point of Premises 
			* connection of fiber from customer side to service provider side 
		* cables 
			* coaxial 
	* DOCASIS standard 
* #### Ethernet 
	* 1000BASE-ZX 
		* based on fiber 
		* Distance of 40 miles over single mode fiber Single Mode fiber is small capacity fiber to transfer light signals over large distance  


## Lan over wan 
* #### tunnels 
	* tunneling provides encapsulation to send data from one end to other end even through incompatible networks 
	* gre 
		* used to transfer data over incompatible network 
		* can be combined with IPSec protocol suite for security 
		* benefits 
			* encapsulation 
				* encapsulating packet to transfer over incompatible network 
			* simplicity 
				* does not support encryption but can be combined with ipsec for security 
			* multicasting 
				* can be used to transfer multicasting traffic unlike VPN which does not support multicast traffic 
		* eg:- DMVPN 
			* protocol type in ip header 
				* 47 
	* IPSec 
		* encapsulate packet to encrypt it and send it over internet 
	* layer 2 
		* pptp 
			* point to point protocol 
		* l2tp 
			* layer 2 tunneling protocol 
	* layer 3 
		* ipsec 
* #### VPN 
	* vpn provide traffic separation 
	* MPLS 
		* L2 VPN 
	* VPLS
