
# Layer 2  

* Values for type field and length field are different for both standards   

## minimum data size is necessary for collision detection to work   

* minimum size is 64 bytes frame.and data in 18(14 + 4{CRC}) bytes ethernet header is 46 bytes   

* maximum data size is necessary to prevent one station monopolizing the shared medium   

## Standards   

### SLIP   

* Serial line IP   

* encapsulates ip to work over serial ports and modem connections   

### Ethernet   

#### ethernet standard   

* has type field   

* minimum data size 46 bytes?   

* maximum data size is 1500bytesmtu(maximum transmission unit)   

#### 802 IEEE standard   

* has length field   

* minimum data size 38 bytes   

* maximum data size 1592bytes   

* used by stp, ISIS, cdp(cisco discovery protocol), vtp   

##### has two headers at second layer   

###### Logical Link layer   

* 3 bytes   

* control   

* snap   

* dsap   
snap header   

* 5 bytes   

###### mac layer   

* 14 bytes   

* lan protocol   

### CSLIP   

* Compressed SLIP   

* during interactive session, small data packets are sent hence tcp/ip header can be compressed to 3-4 bytes   

### PPP   

* Used for asynchronous and synchronous circuits   

* It is replacement for SLIP   

#### Small maximum data size   

* usefull for interactive sessions for small delay   

* wan protocol   

## protocols   

### ARP Protocol   

#### fields   

##### protocol type 1   

* 0x0800 for ip addr   

##### hard type 1   

* 1 for ethernet   

##### protocol size 2   

* 4 bytes for ip addr   

##### hardsize 2   

* 6 bytes for hardware addr   

##### opcode 2   

* 1 for requestr   

* 2 reply   

* 3 rarp request   

* 4 rarp reply   

#### 4 fields changes during reply   

* target ethernet addr being filled   

* destination/source address swapped   

* op field changed to reply   

* 28 bytes ARP request/reply header   

#### there are no retransmission in arp   

* tcp retransmission causes arp to follow exponential backoff

# ARP  

* also called as Hardware Broadcast   

## Fields   

### prot type   

* 2 bytes   

* value: 0x0800 - ip   

### hard type   

* 2 bytes   

* value: 1 - ethernet   

### hard size   

* 1 byte   

* represents size in bytes   

### proto size   

* 1 byte   

* represent size in bytes   

### op   

* 2 byte   

* arp req: 1   

* arp rep: 2   

* rarp req: 3   

* rarp rep: 4   

* source ethernet add   

* destination ethernet addr   

* source ip addr   

* destination ip addr   

* total header length: 28 bytes   

## In arp request   

* ethernet destionation addr: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff   

* target mac address: 00:00:00:00:00   

* there are no retransmission for arp   

## proxy arp   

* router answer an arp request for destination host on another netowrk   

## gratitious arp   

* send arp requestion target ip address to ip address of it's own   

* this is used just to check if assigned ip address is used by any other host or not   

* This is used during boot of system   

* rarp is used to find out the ip address, gratitious arp is used to check the ip addres   

* source ip - IPsource mac - MACtarget ip - IPtarget mac - 00:00:00:00:00:00   

* issued after system has booted up and checked if assigned ip is already on network or not   

* arp is independent of upper layer(L3) and lower Layer(L2) because uses hard type and prot type fields which tells us about the type of protocol in upper layer and type of frame in lower layer   

* sending arp packet with broadcast address as source address   

# RARP  

## headers for ethernet header   

* source mac - Mac   

* destination mac - ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff   

## rarp headers   

* source mac: MAC   

* destination mac: MAC   

* source ip: 0.0.0.0   

* destination ip: 0.0.0.0   

* there is no provision for assigning subnet mask. RARP was acceptable in early days of classful addressing but it became absolete when classless adressing became standard.BOOTP protocol is alternate and can supply subnet mask too   

* used during boot when diskless system needs to finds it's ip address and than issues request to tftp server for boot image
