# IP header  

## version   

* 4 bit   

## header length   

### size - 4 bit   

* 4 bytes   

* Each value represents 4 byte   

* min size - 20 bytes(Value)   

* max size - 60 bytes(Value)   

* Also called Internet header length   

## Type of Service   

* 8 bit   

## packet length   

### size - 16 bit   

* each value represent 1 byte   

* min size - 20 bytes(with no data)   

* if bigger than mtu, than fragmentation occurs   

## identification   

* 16 bit   

## fragment offset   

* 13 bit   

## flags   

* 3 bit   

* DF(Dont fragment)   

* MF(More fragment)   

## protocol(identifier)   

* 8 bit(1 byte)   

* icmp 1   

* igmp 2   

* tcp 6   

* udp 17   

* ah 51   

* esp 50   

* gre 47   

## time to live   

* 8 bit   

## source address   

* 32 bit   

## target address   

* 32 bit   

## options   

* 40 bytes   

### during record route option, can carry around 9 ip address 9*4 = 36 bytes and other 3 bytes for code, len and ptr   

* record route option has disadvantage that 1. It can only store 9 addresses2. it takes router from ts capability   

## checksum   

* 16 bit   

* only covers the header   

### why this field not present in ipv6?   

* because checksum services are provided by upper layers   

## IP protocol   

### properties   

#### unreliable   

* reliability is maintained by upper layers   

* In case ip datagram is discarded, ICMP message is sent back   

#### connectionless   

* no state information is maintained   

### big endian byte order or network byte order   

* means most significant bit i.e left most bit will be transfered first   

* checksum is updated by every hop in path to reach destination as ttl needs to decremented every time   

### options   

* security and handling   

* route record   

* timestamp   

#### loose source routing   

* list of ip address which must be traversed   

#### string source routing   

* list of only ip address that are to be traversed   

* If destination ip address does not match the host ip address than datagram is discarded silently   

### drawback of fragmentation   

#### if one fragment is lost, the entire datagram has to be sent again   

* because fragmentation does not have retransmission.fragmentation occurs at ip layer   

# ICMP  

* rest of fields depend on type   

## first 4 bytes   

### type   

* 1 bytes   

### code   

* 1 bytes   

### checksum   

* 2 bytes   

* covers entire ICMP message   

## second four bytes   

* empty   

* last 2 bytes are used by router to put MTU of outgoing interface when fragmentation is required but dont fragment is set (In case of icmp error)   

* used by ping program [anchor](xmind:#7cekfc52d7ojhpon4t44g1dbjg "anchor")  

## optional data.this is not options   

* used by ping program [anchor](xmind:#7cekfc52d7ojhpon4t44g1dbjg "anchor")  

* network management and diagnostic   

## tracert   

### for request uses udp   

* Actually sending udp packet with increasing ttl and random port is old method of using tracrt, now we can use tcp and icmp echo request too.main motive of using udp is that icmp requires special permissions to send while udp requires no special permission   

### for response uses icmp   

* icmp time exceeded error msg   

* icmp destination unreachable port unreachable   

* 3 probes are sent to each hop by default   

## ping   

* uses icmp msgs   

## certainspoints   

* everyone on internet does not send back the icmp messages   

## ICMP error   

* has ip header(20 bytes) + first 8 bytes of ip datagram data   

### icmp error message is never generated for following   

* when source address is not single machine   

* destion address is broadcast or multicast address   

* for icmp error message   

* fragment other than first fragment   

* link layer broadcast   

* always has first 4 bytes, next four bytes are always zero   

### header fields   

* type   

* code   

* checksum   

* it never has optional data field of icmp request message   

## certain type and code values   

### type 0, code 0   

* echo reply   

### type 8, code 0   

* echo request   

### type 3destination unreachable   

#### code 0   

* network unreachable   

#### code 1   

* host unreachable   

#### code 3   

* protocol unreachable   

#### code 4   

* port unreachable   

## Ping program   

* ping program uses second 4 bytes   

### identifier field   

* 2 bytes   

* tell us about the process   

### sequence number   

* 2 bytes   

* used to connect echo request with echo replies   

### option data contains the time at which icmp request was sent   

* rtt(round trip time) is calculated when icmp reply is received because it contains the outgoing time and difference is calculated with current time   

* has potential of being hacked because responder can change the time in received frame just change analysis for round trip time at requester   

## Traceroute   

* ttl for each datagram is increased by 1 for every outgoing packet   

* uses udp packet for outgoing packets.some traceroute program uses icmp request packets too   

* udp port number is used to map outgoing request with incoming reply   

* rtt is calculated by host by keeping the track of time at which udp was sent than calculating the difference when icmp error message comes back   

* icmp time-to-live exceeded error message is received   

# Multicast  

## IP to mac addr   

### first 3 bytes are fixed   

* 01:00:5e:   

* most significant bit of 4 byte is always zero   

* last 23 bits are mapped one to one from ip to mac   

* packets can be received by multiple processes on same host   

* multicast services takes in multicast traffic and do whatever it want to do and than forward it   

# IGMP  

## fixed size packet   

* 8 byte packet   

## fields   

### version   

* 4 bit   

### igmp type   

* 4 bit   

* query   

* membership report   

* leave report   

* special query   

### unused   

* 8 bit   

### checksum   

* 2 byte   

### ipaddress   

* 4 byte
