## Public key cryptography   

* two keys, one private and one public   

* when public key used for encryption and private key for decryption than it is used for cryptography   

### when public key is used for decryption and private key for encryption than it is used to generate digital signatures   

* It is called signature because it shares handwritten signature property   

## checksum   

* They are for integrity check   

### CRC   

* creating a fixed size hash of somekind and used against issue caused by faulty hardware.   

* Intelligent hacker can be change the checksum while changing the message.   

### secret checksum algorigthm   

* using secret algorithm to create checksum can helpful against intelligent hacker.   

* we should follow the same philosphy of making public algorithms and secret key   

### cryptographic checksum   

* algorithm is public but key is secret to create checksum(MAC - message authentication code or MIC - message integrity code)
