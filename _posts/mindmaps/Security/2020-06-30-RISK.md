* SLE   

* SPOF   

### Strategy of dealing with risk   

#### risk avoidance   

* avoid the risk   

#### risk transference   

* ofloading risk using third-party contracts, insurance and shared responsibility   

#### risk deterrence   

* discourage the attackers   

#### risk mitigation   

* lessen the risk   

## risk assesment or risk analysis   

* threat   

### vulnerability   

* weakness exploited by threat   

* it's impact   

* we have to collect information on about what are all the possible risk organization is facing   

* probablity of risk happening, most probable requires most attention   

* analysing the impact of risk   

* creating plan on how to respond to it   

### risk assesment caclulations   

#### ALE(Annual Loss Expectancy)   

* monetory value of amt of loss in one year   

#### SLE(Single Loss Expentancy)   

* monetory value of amt of loss in any given time   

##### componentsSLE = Exposure Value * Asset Value   

* Exposure factor   

* Asset Value   

#### ARO(Annualized rate of occurence)   

* rate of occurence of event in year   

* SLE * ARO = ALE   

### qualitative and quantitative   

#### qualitative   

* loss of opinion of important information, reputation etc   

#### quantitative   

* loss interms of money   

* risk measurements   

### Acting of risk assesment   

#### risk avoidance   

* not doing things which have risk factor   

#### risk transference   

* sharing risk with third parties like insurance or cloud providers or consulting firms   

#### risk mitigation   

* reducing risk by taking some measures   

#### risk acceptance   

* accepting risk and doing nothing about it   

### Risk associated with cloud   

* compliance   

* user priviledges   

* data integeration/segregation   

### Risk Associated with virtualization   

#### breaking out of virtual machine   

* hypervisor is software which enables virtual machines to exist. Try to read hardening guides provided by hypervisor vendors to keep it secure and apply patches to keep it up to date   

#### intermingling of network and security controls   

* tools used to monitor virtual machines may not provide the same granularity for network management   

### Frameworks available   

* NIST, COBIT

# Security Devices  

## Acess Point(AP)   

* acts as switch, router, firewall, dhcp server   

### fat AP   

* autonomous AP needs to be manually configured with network and security settings   

### thin AP   

* allows for remote configuration using controller   

### standalone APor Thick AP   

* They do not require controller for configuration   

### controller-based AP   

* AP's that use controller for central management of configuration and policy   

## SIEM(Security Information and event management)   

* manages and time synchronizes and deduplication of events from multiple sources   

## Data Loss Prevention(DLP)   

* monitor loss/deletion, modification and access control   

* opensource tools like mydlp   

## Network Access Control(NAC)   

* deals with operation security rather than physical security   

* new devices to be attached to network has some requirements to be followed   

### nac agents i.e permanent or dissolvable can be installed on system to verfiy devie   

* it checks if antivirus is up-to-date, perform other host healthy checks   

* dissolvable are ones installed only for session   

## Mail Gateway   

* route emails, encrypt, spam filter for both incoming and outgoing emails, DLP   

## Hardware Security Module(HSM)   

* is cryptoprocessor   

## Trusted Platform module(TPM)   

* device to store keys, hashes etc   

## Switch   

* port security   

* flood guards   

### possible attacks   

* dhcp snooping   

* arp inspection   

* Mac Adress filtering   

* VLAN assignment   

## Proxy   

### forwarding proxy   

* service is accessed as proxy as requester   

### backward proxy   

* proxy is front-end of service hosted in internal network   

* used as load balancer   

### transparent proxy   

* not much change in request response beyond that is required for authentication authorization   

### non-transparent proxy   

* request is modified in order to provide addtional services to user   

* group annotation service, media type transformation, protocol reduction, anonymity filtering   

## Load Balancer   

### scheduling   

#### round robin   

* every server is given request one by one   

#### affinity   

* like services to like servers   

### active-active   

* multiple load balancer servers are used   

### active passive   

* one is primary server, and secondary server is used when primary server is overwhelmed   

### Virtual IP(VIP)   

* similiar to dns based load balancer but more flexible than it   

* load balancing between multiple interfaces for both inbound and outbound workloads   

## Firewall   

* packet filtering   

### proxy firewall   

* application level proxy   

* circuit level proxy   

* statefull packet inspection firewal   

## UTM   

### Unified Threat Management   

* url filtering   

* content filtering   

* malware inspection   

## application firewalls   

* cross-site scripting   

* injection attacks   

* forged http requests   

## application aware devices   

* has snmp and quality of serivce to prioritize traffic   

## VPN   

* Layer 2 tunneling protocol   

### IPSec   

#### tunneling mode   

* encrypts both payload and header   

#### transport mode   

* encyrpts only payload   

* Point to Point Tunneling protocol   

### full tunnel   

* encrypt and route all outgoing traffic   

### split tunnel   

* encrypts and route some of outgoing traffic   

## Intrusion Detection System   

* passive   

* tries to provide real time picture of your network   

* traffic auditing device   

* reporting events that deviate from historical traffic patterns   

### detection techniques   

#### behaviour-based detection   

* behaviour is not only of human but networking devices like if particular type of traffic increased   

* signature based detection(Misuse Detection)   

* anomaly Detection   

### Network Based IDS   

#### can be attached before or after firewall   

* if attached before firewall, IDS will monitor all the traffic going into network. Huge amount of data is processed   

* If attached after firewall, IDS will only filtered traffic by firewall   

* IDS is attached using tap or on monitoring port of switch. Port spanning or port mirroring copies traffic from all ports to single port. Cisco Switched Port Analyzer(SPAN) is one example of port-spanning   

### Host Based IDS   

* monitor machine logs, system events, application interactions but does not monitor network traffic   

#### problems   

* needs to be installed on every host   

* if host is compromised than log files can be corrupt hence fault determination is difficult   

#### advantages   

* can read memory   

* recovery is easy because we can know which files were altered on host be keeping checksum of files   

## IPS   

* active/inline   

## Routers   

### ACL's   

* access control list makes router act as packet filtering firewall   

#### antispoofing protections   

* detects source ip address spoofing   

## SSL accelerators   

* separate processor to encrypt data using private public key to ofload from general processor   

## SSL decryptors   

* decrypts data, process it and than again encrypt it to inspect encrypted data   

## sensor   

* collects data and send to idp/ips   

## operator   

### receives notification   

* when there is event   

### controls ids/ips using console which is called as manager   

* controls ips/ids   

## Inband / outband management   

### inband   

* local management   

### outband   

* remote management   

## Active/Passive Response   

### active   

#### action is taken when ids detects intrusion in real time   

##### terminating process or connection   

* sending TCP RST flag to all active connections   

##### Network configuration changes   

* blocking request from certain ip or port on firewall   

##### deception   

* redirecting attacker to honeypot where we can log all different activities of attacker   

### passive   

#### ids detects intrusion in real time but it takes one of three actins   

* logging   

* notification   

##### shunning   

* ignoring attack because attach is irrelevant to target   

* eg:- IIS attack on apache web server   

## data source   

### activity   

#### malicious activity is event   

* event generates alert
