# Security

## Layer 2 
* #### port security(pdf - 25) 
	* limit on no. of mac address 
	* mac-address filtering 
		* violation Three ways to handle violation  

			* protect 
				* packet is dropped with no logging 
			* restrict 
				* packet is dropped wiht logging and snmp trap message 
			* shutdown port 
				* interface is changed to down state with logging and snmp trap message 
				* Recovery 
					* automatic 
						* agging time 
							* after this time, it port will automatically change it's state to up 
					* manual 
				* default no. of mac-address 1 
			* shutdown vlan 
		* modes 
			* Static 
				* mac address is pre configured 
				* when we set mac-address, they are set in ram(running-config). we have to write them to startup configuration 
			* Sticky 
				* switch learns mac address based on first availaible mac address 
				* mac-address learn dynamically can be copied to start-up configuration 
			* dynamic 
				* dynamically learns mac-address 
* #### port based securityAAA - Authentication, Authorization and accounting 
	* Access will be provided to users having access credentials 
	* imagine a case where somebody plugs in access point in switch, and gives access to no of people having access to his access point.This attack can be stopped by allowing users having valid credentials to access the netowrk 
* #### dhcp snooping 
	* some host tries to do man in the middle attack, by becoming gateway for other host by issuing dhcp offer response. 
* #### preventing mac address flooding 
	* swittches are flooded with packets with different mac address and hence filling the switch mac-address table hence every packets started getting flooded 
	* port security can be used to prevent getting more mac-address out from switch interface 
* #### mac address inspection 
	* using dhcp snooping creates a table which has binding for mac-address and ip address with each port hence any host sending arp response with spoofed mac-address(gratious arp) is stopped 
* #### protection against other switches becoming root 
	* bpdu guard, bpdu filter, root guard all these modes help switch from attacker change the spanning tree topology 
* #### protection against vlan hopping 
	* auto negotiation is enabled by default on switch ports/interfaces, hence host can force switch interface to work in trunk mode hence he can communicate with any vlan 

## Layer 3 
* #### Access List 
	* standard 
	* extended 
	* Can be applied at different places 
		* inbound 
		* outbound 
		* VTY lines to secure telnet and ssh traffic 
* #### Security used for 2 different things 
	* filtering 
		* access list is used to provide this 
		* can be used to drop or accept packets 
	* classification 
		* used to select packets 
			* eg:- traffic from particular subnet be selected and used for encrypted under vpn
