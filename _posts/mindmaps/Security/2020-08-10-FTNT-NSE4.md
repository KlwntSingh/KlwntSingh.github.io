# Basic

## High-Level 
* #### Deployment modes 
	* Distributed enterprise firewall 
	* Next generation firewall 
	* Internal segmentation firewall 
		* used to contain network breach 
	* Data center firewall 
		* monitor inbound requests to servers and protect them without increasing latency to requester 
* #### Notes 
	* Security perimeter is no longer solid. malicious actors can penetrate this perimeter very easiliy be it malicious usb, compromised employee's device connected to corporate network etc. 
		* Different things to consider in perimeter 
			* mobile workforce 
			* partners accessing your network 
			* public, private clouds 
			* IOT 
			* BYOD 
	* FGT is modular, meaning you can enable features which are useful to you and disable others. Add other FTNT products to improve efficiency and security. 
		* eg:- rather than buying separate security appliances, single FGT is enough with UTM(unified threat management) for smaller-mid size business 
	* Virtualizaton 
		* FGT VM 
			* does not have spu's like physical fgt has 
			* used when you need fast deployment and tear down in large number with similar cheap hardwares 
		* FGT VMX 
			* replaces network component of VMware nsx to provide additional security between network traffic of guest vm's hense giving east-west flow 
		* Cisco ACI connector 
			* alllow aci to deploy fgt for north-south flow 
	* hardware acceralation offloads processing from cpu to asics. Sessions offloaded can be seen in gui. per-session accounting enables to see all the sessions offloaded 
* #### ASICS 
	* SPU 
		* Security processing Units 
		* NP 
			* Network Processor 
			* for packet forwarding incase of high volume traffic 
			* directly attached to network interface 
			* NTurbo 
				* offloads flow based security profiles to NP6, NP7 network processors 
			* eg:- NP7, NP6, NP6lite processor 
	* CP 
		* Content processor 
		* for virus scanning, attack detection, encryption/decryption 
		* not bound to interface, closer to application 
		* eg:- CP9 
	* SP 
		* Security processor 
		* provides IPS 
		* 1. directly attached to interface2. can work at system level too 
		* eg:- SP3, LP, XG2, XE2, FE8 andCE4 
	* SoC 
		* entry level optimizations 
		* Nturbo included 
		* eg: SoC4(entry level) - with CP, NP and RISC CPU 

## Setup 
* #### vdoms 
	* by default disabled. 
	* one vdom is always there even if disabled, root vdom 
	* vdom is concept of dividing FGT into multiple virtual FGT as if they were separate FGT's 
* #### two modes 
	* NAT 
		* FGT as router 
		* default mode 
	* Transparent 
		* FGT as switch/bridge 
		* one of interface has ip for management 
* #### port 
	* dedicated management port 
		* only on high end models 
	* usb management port/ console port 
		* used to manage FGT without network 
	* ports 
		* can be used to access FGT and mangement it 
* #### fds 
	* for package updates 
		* avdb, ips db 
			* since no frequent changes in db so downloaded once a day 
		* update.fortiguard.net [anchor](update.fortiguard.net "anchor")
		* port - 443 
	* live queries 
		* Web Filtering, DNS Filtering and antispam 
			* db's are not downloading because of their size and frequent changes 
		* service.fortiguard.net [anchor](service.fortinet.net "anchor")
		* servicewf.fortiguard.net [anchor](servicewf.fortiguard.net "anchor")
		* port - udp 8888, ssl 443
