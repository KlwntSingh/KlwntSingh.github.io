# chapter 1

## High-Level 
* #### Deployment modes 
	* Distributed enterprise firewall 
	* Next generation firewall 
	* Internal segmentation firewall 
		* used to contain network breach 
	* Data center firewall 
		* monitor inbound requests to servers and protect them without increasing latency to requester 
* #### Notes 
	* Security perimeter is no longer solid. malicious actors can penetrate this perimeter very easiliy be it malicious usb, compromised employee's device connected to corporate network etc. 
		* Different things to consider in perimeter 
			* mobile workforce 
			* partners accessing your network 
			* public, private clouds 
			* IOT 
			* BYOD 
	* FGT is modular, meaning you can enable features which are useful to you and disable others. Add other FTNT products to improve efficiency and security. 
		* eg:- rather than buying separate security appliances, single FGT is enough with UTM(unified threat management) for smaller-mid size business 
	* Virtualizaton 
		* FGT VM 
			* does not have spu's like physical fgt has 
			* used when you need fast deployment and tear down in large number with similar cheap hardwares 
		* FGT VMX 
			* replaces network component of VMware nsx to provide additional security between network traffic of guest vm's hense giving east-west flow 
		* Cisco ACI connector 
			* alllow aci to deploy fgt for north-south flow 
	* hardware acceralation offloads processing from cpu to asics. Sessions offloaded can be seen in gui. per-session accounting enables to see all the sessions offloaded 
* #### ASICS 
	* SPU 
		* Security processing Units 
		* NP 
			* Network Processor 
			* for packet forwarding incase of high volume traffic 
			* directly attached to network interface 
			* NTurbo 
				* offloads flow based security profiles to NP6, NP7 network processors 
			* eg:- NP7, NP6, NP6lite processor 
	* CP 
		* Content processor 
		* for virus scanning, attack detection, encryption/decryption 
		* not bound to interface, closer to application 
		* eg:- CP9 
	* SP 
		* Security processor 
		* provides IPS 
		* 1. directly attached to interface2. can work at system level too 
		* eg:- SP3, LP, XG2, XE2, FE8 andCE4 
	* SoC 
		* entry level optimizations 
		* Nturbo included 
		* eg: SoC4(entry level) - with CP, NP and RISC CPU 

## Setup 
* #### vdoms 
	* by default disabled. 
	* one vdom is always there even if disabled, root vdom 
	* vdom is concept of dividing FGT into multiple virtual FGT as if they were separate FGT's 
* #### default conf 
	* ping, http, https and ssh enabled. these are mostly called management protocols 
	* NAT mode with single vdom(root vdom) 
	* Fortiguard access is anycast to optimize routing performance. anycast forces use of https protocol 
* #### two modes 
	* NAT 
		* FGT as router 
		* default mode 
	* Transparent 
		* FGT as switch/bridge 
		* one of interface has ip for management 
* #### port 
	* dedicated physical management port 
		* only on high end models 
	* usb management port/ console port 
		* used to manage FGT without network 
	* ports 
		* can be used to access FGT and management of it 
		* also called internal interfaces 
		* management protocols are used here to management FGT [anchor](xmind:#6a26bmjcna28n9ejcvdohilegm "anchor")
* #### fds 
	* for package updates 
		* avdb, ips db 
			* since no frequent changes in db so downloaded once a day 
		* update.fortiguard.net [anchor](update.fortiguard.net "anchor")
		* port - 443 
	* live queries 
		* Web Filtering, DNS Filtering and antispam 
			* db's are not downloading because of their size and frequent changes 
		* service.fortiguard.net [anchor](service.fortinet.net "anchor")
		* servicewf.fortiguard.net [anchor](servicewf.fortiguard.net "anchor")
		* port - udp 8888, ssl 443 
			* here protocol requirements is speed and not fault tolerance 
	* Fortiguard implements OCSP stapling technique to get certificate status and then this status if used by FGT to verify certificate efficiently. Fortiguard queries OCSP check every 4 hrs 
	* FGT aborts connection to Fortiguard if: 
		* cn in certificate does not match the domain name resolved from dns 
		* ocsp status not good 
		* issuerCA revoked by rootCA 

## Basic Administration 
* #### methods 
	* cli 
		* console, telnet, ssh, gui cli widget 
		* reports cannot be viewed here 
	* gui 
		* fortiexplorer 
		* browser using http/https 
		* advanced settings and diagnostics commands for super user not available here 
	* other administrative protocols 
		* snmp 
			* ready-only, can't be used for setup 
* #### users 
	* there should be separate user accnt for diferent administrators. helpful in tracking and tracking purposes 
	* authentication can be using passwords, remote auth servers, digital certificates and fortitoken 
	* when resetting lost password 
		* maintainer user accnt by default. username - maintainer, password - bcpb<serialnumber>. Note: this accnt is only active for around 60 after power cycle 
			* this maintainer accnt can be disabled but then you also loose the way to reset password 
		* reset to factory default 
* #### admin profiles 
	* defines scope of action by assigning set of permissions to user 
	* super_admin 
		* assigned to admin user, cannot be changed 
	* prof_admin 
		* same as super_admin but assigned to limit permissions to individual vdom and can be changed 
	* inactivity_timeout is per-profile setting 
	* users with lower set of permissions cannot even users with more permissions 
* #### Administrative Access 
	* multi-factor auth 
	* trusted hosts 
		* by default conf is 0.0.0.0/0 
		* when administrators login from ip different from one configured in trusted host, then they don't get auth failure but rather 'Unable to contact server' 
		* NATed translation defeats trusted hosts 
	* ports 
		* http,https,ssh,telnet ports are customizable 
	* password policy 
		* defining criteria what should be there is password line numbers, special character etc 
	* idle timeout 
		* default 5 minutes 
		* this can be overridden by setting in profiles [anchor](xmind:#2tobpfov8nplt7jrdgkj65hdjn "anchor")
		* shorter more secure 
	* concurrent sessions 
	* protocols 
		* management protocols [anchor](xmind:#6a26bmjcna28n9ejcvdohilegm "anchor")
			* separate for both ipv4, ipv6 and it's per interface 
			* telnet, ipv6 is hidden by default 
			* insecure protocols like http and telnet should not be used 
		* protocols where FGT is destination ip 
			* security fabric 
				* capwap 
					* fortiap, fortiextender, fortiswitch 
				* fortitelemetry 
			* fmg-access 
				* for communication with fortimanager 
			* ftmfortitoken mobile push 
				* supports two-factor auth requests from fortitoken app 
			* radius accnting 
				* for processing radius accounting packets for single-sign on 
		* LLDP 
			* detecting upstream security fabric 
	* hidding features(feature visibility) 
		* ipv6 hidden by default 
		* multiple interface policies 
			* enable/disable to put multiple interfaces in policies 
		* hidding feature does not disable it. it works in background 
		* allow unnamed policies 
			* to have firewall policies without name in gui but in cli policies can already exists without name 
		* voip security profile is hidden by default 
* #### Interface types 
	* physical interface 
		* port to interface direct mapping 
	* link aggregation 
		* logical channel consisting of multiple ports for increased bandwidth and high availability by providing redundancy 
	* zones 
		* logical grouping of interfaces 
		* once added to zone, interface cannot be referenced individually 
* #### Interface IP 
	* NAT 
		* NAT mode always require ip on interface since FGT is now acting as router 
		* three ways to assign ip 
			* dhcp 
			* ppoe 
			* manual 
	* one-arm sniffer 
		* when interface is selected as one-arm sniffer, interface receives copy of packet from mirrored port on switch 
* #### Interface roles 
	* roles is basically preconfigured interface settings grouped together to avoid misconfiguration 
		* eg: wan role has disabled all dhcp server and device detection related configuration in gui 
	* 4 types 
		* wan 
		* lan 
		* dmz 
		* undefined 
			* shows all settings 
* #### interface alias 
	* friendly interface description or interface name 
	* you can label them by purpose 
* #### static gateway 
	* gateway should be added in FGT so that i can forward the packet to next router for further routing 
	* if ip address received is by dhcp/ppoe then it must have received default gateway otherwise we have create default static route 

## Servers 
* #### dhcp 
	* when ip addr on interface is manual, we can select it to act as dhcp server 
	* three types ip assignment rules 
		* assign ip 
		* block 
		* reserve ip 
* #### dns 
	* enabled per interface 
	* dns database can be shared by all interfaces but can be separate for vdoms 
	* resolution methods 
		* forward 
			* relay requests to configured dns server in system settings. it act as relay server and not as dns server 
		* non-recursive 
			* use internal dns database only 
		* recursive 
			* use internal dns database and if no result found forward to it next server 
	* dns database 
		* dns zones 
			* each dns zone has it's own domain name 

## Fundamental maintainence 
* #### configuration backup 
	* we can have separate configuration backup for separate vdoms 
	* when encrypting configuration file with password, it can only be decrypted on FGT with same model and firmware. encrypted configuration file has header in plaintext which includes model, firmware release number and build number and rest of file is encrypted and unreadable 
	* for unencrypted file, file can be restored only on FGT with same model number 
* configuration restore 
* #### dowgrade firmware 
	* read release notes before doing downgrade 
* #### upgrade firmware 
	* read release notes before doing upgrade 
* #### firmware 
	* firmware is basically fortios release number with build number 
* #### reason to have physical access 
	* when downgrading/upgrading is using unsupported paths, translation scripts might loose settings 
	* firmware which you are uploading is corrupted 
	* older firmwares do not have ability convert later configurations

## deploying security fabric 
* #### root FGT 
	* enable security fabric connection on interfaces facing downstream FGT's 
	* on fabric connector page, configure edge FGT as root FGT and configure FAZ on this FGT 
	* you can pre-authorize downstream FGT's by adding their serial number 
* #### downstream FGT 
	* enable security fabric connection on interfaces facing upstream FGT 
	* On Fabric connectors page, join existing fabric put in root FGT ip 
* now authorize downstream FGT's on upstream FGT and both downstream and upstream on FAZ 
* #### split-task vdoms 
	* root vdom 
	* global vdom 
	* FG-traffic vdom 
* #### device identification 
	* agentless 
		* requires direct connection with FGT meaning there is no layer3 device between endpoint and FGT 
		* devices are indexed by mac addr 
		* HTTP user-Agent header, TCP fingerprint, MAC address OUI, andFortiOS-VM detection methods 
	* FCT 
		* location and infrastructure independent 
		* devices are indexed by fct user id(UID) 
	* needs to be enabled on interfaces

* #### security fabric posture widget 
	* latest security rating for security fabric 
	* security ratings are calculated using security audits are automated and can run on demand. security audit generate reports which are sent to fortiguard for analysis and get security posture score 
	* you can compare security rating to other organizations in same industry or organization of all industries or to your organization region or all regions 
	* you should have valid security rating license in all the FGT's 
	* security posture ranking by percentile from fortiguard 

## security fabric rating 
* this is fortiguard subscription based rating service

# Chaper 3

## matching criteria 
* when packet arrives, fgt start matching it with policies from start and as soon as match found respective action is triggered. if no matching policy found, implicit deny drops the packet 

## comparison of policies 
* #### firewall policies 
	* implicity deny 
	* limit access to network 
* #### security profile 
	* protects network, utm protection for virus, web filtering and application control 
	* security profile process packets when firewall policy has allowed the traffic 
	* implicit allow 
		* because no matching malware signature found in packet, it should be allowed 
	* when inspecting traffic, two way 
		* flow based 
		* proxy based 

## components of policy 
* #### objects 
	* interfaces, zones, nat rules, security profile, schedules, service definations, users 
	* interface 
* #### types 
	* ipv4, ipv6, multicast etc 
* #### matching criteria 
	* incoming interface 
	* outgoing interface 
	* source 
		* ip, user, internet service(ISDB) 
		* address 
			* ip 
			* subnet 
			* fqdn 
				* if selecting fqdn as source then dns need to resolve on FGT, other policy will show warning 
			* geography 
				* defines group of range of addresses allocated to country 
				* fortiguard updates database periodically 
			* fabric connector address 
		* user 
			* user is authenticated before allow/deny access based on policy 
			* three types of users 
				* local 
				* remote - radius, ldap 
				* FSSO 
		* ISDB 
			* database with ip, protocol and port numbers used by most common internet services 
			* regularly updated by fortiguard 
			* if this is used as source, we can't use address with this 
			* if this is used in destination, we can't use address or services 
			* eg: FB, dropbox, AWS etc 
			* geoghraphy based ISDB 
				* more fine grained control over service based on country, region, city 
				* created by users 
		* combinations 
			* ip and user can go together 
			* ip and ISDB can't go together 
	* destination 
		* ip, internet service 
		* same as source 
		* there is no user in destination because user identification is only on ingress interface and once user is identified then it can be send to egress interface 
	* service 
		* ip protocol and port number 
		* can be pre-defined or custom 
		* mostly destination port is defined because in modern applications source port is random 
		* eg:- http, https 
	* schedule 
		* applies during configured time 
* #### scheduling 
	* policies applying only during specific time and day 
	* types 
		* recurring 
			* happens at same time during specified days of week 
			* if all day selected, policy will be active for 24 hrs 
			* if stop time is earlier than start time, it will stop next day 
			* if start and stop time are identical, then it will run for 24 hrs 
		* one time 
			* start time must be earlier than stop time 
			* pre-expiration event log, logging n day before schedule expires, 1<=n<=100days 
	* Subtopic 3 
* #### other options in policies 
	* such as firewall and network options, security profiles, logging options, and enabling or disabling a policy 
	* security profile [anchor](xmind:#32n1m9p6blmb4qgh5jcftoia76 "anchor")
	* logging 
		* by default, Log Allowed Traffic set to security events i.e logs for applied security profiles. can be changed to all sessions 
		* log is generated after firewall policy closes the session 
		* option to enable generate Logs when Session Start 
			* if internal storage is not present then this is cli-only option, logtraffic-start 
		* during session, if policy detects violation, logs immediately. 
			* to improve performance, we can enable session table entry for denied sessions which will automatically deny all packets for denied session and also will not do policy lookup for packets in denied session hence reducing cpu usage and log entries. This option is in cli-only ses-denied-traffic and by default timeout is 30 seconds 
	* traffic shappers 
		* can provide 
			* maximum bandwidth 
			* guaranteed bandwidth 
		* types 
			* shared 
				* bandwidth management of security policies using same shaper 
			* per-ip 
				* bandwidth management of user ip addr 
			* application control 
				* bandwidth management by application 
		* udp traffic may not gracefully recover from packet loss 
	* consolidated policies 
		* both ipv4, ipv6 can exists in firewall policies only condition that ip version in source and destination should match. 
		* when upgrading from 6.2.3 to 6.4, consolidated policies will change to firewall policies 
* when policy is created UUID is added which improve integration with fortimanager and FAZ 
* since firewall policies are stateful, only one direction flow of traffic that initiates the session is required, fgt automatically handles replies 

## managing policies 
* #### policy list 
	* interface pair view 
	* by sequence
