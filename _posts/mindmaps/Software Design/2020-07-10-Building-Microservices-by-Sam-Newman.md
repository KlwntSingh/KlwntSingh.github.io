## different architectures   

* traditional tiered   

* service oriented   

* distributed system   

* microservices   

## Characterstics   

* small   

### Autonomous   

#### achieving decoupling   

* have less exposure of data models to other services. if there is too much sharing, services beocmes coupled   

* having technology agnostic api's   

## Benefits   

### technology heterogenity   

#### Using best technology which suites the service. differen technologies can be used for different service   

* eg: For high performing services, we can decide technology which delivers high performance   

* adopting new technology is easy as we don't have write whole system in new technology just the service we want to implement   

* Resilience   

* Scaling   

* Ease of Deployment   

* Organizational Alignment   

* Composability   

* Optimizing for replaceability   

## Comparing with others   

* SOA   

### Decompositional techniques   

* shared libraries   

* modules   

## Problems   

### there are challenges when we have more moving parts(services)   

* newer technologies themselves provide ease with deployment   

* mostly problems are same as of distributed system
