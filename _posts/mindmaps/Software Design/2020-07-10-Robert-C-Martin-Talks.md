# Clean Code

## Every 5 years, programmer double 
* hence half the programmers have less than 5 years of experience 

## high level and low level functions 
* function should have high level functionality and low level functionality together 
* high level functions should delegate calls to low level functions 
* write a messy function, then use refactor technique of extracting functions 

## more scope of function, smaller the name of function 

## more scope of variable, bigger the name of variable 

## estimate time of implementation 
* is usually 3 times time to do it physically 

## Deciding how big should be function interms of lines of code 

## actor model for limited stacks machines 

## number of args are more than 3, better to have object with properties to pass
