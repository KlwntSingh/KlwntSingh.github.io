# History

## Machine Code 
* 8080, PDP emulator 

## ECP-18 
* judy allen 

## Assembly Language 
* #### BAL 
	* Basic Assembly Language 

## Fortran 
* 1953 
* without indentation 
* no blocking 
* look alike assembly language 

## ALGOL-60 
* lowercase 
* got italics 
* blocks 
* indenting 
* Just in books and documents 

## LISP 
* by john maccarthy 
* 1957 
* oldest language still with us 
* refuses to die 
* attempt towards functional language 

## COBOL 
* 1959 
* by grace hopper 
* code should look like natural language 
* disaster, no code is written nowadays, only for maintenance 

## Basic 
* 1964 
* compliled language 

## PDP-8 Assembler 
* late 60's 
* a simple symbolic language 

## SIMULA-67 
* first OO language 
* #### function stack frame to heap 
	* objects were born 
* inheritance 
* polymorphism 
* classes 
* objects 

## Ken & Ritchie - 1968 
* ASM --> BCPL --> B --> C 
* Multics 
* UNIX 

## SmallTalk 
* 1972 
* changed very narrow community 
* GUI 
* code is not written in source file but in database 
* minimum syntax language 
* most OO language ever 

## C++ 
* by bjarne stroustrop 
* SIMULA-67 --> C++ 
* C front with simula like functionality 
* C with classes name change to C++ 

## Java 
* C++ --> OAK --> Java 
* 1981 
* by james gosling 
* simplified copy of c++ 

## Ruby | Python 
* ruby - 1993 
* python - 1989 
* until this time, language were staticly type 
* dynamically typed

# Paradigms

## First language 
* by Alan Turing 
* 1936 
* #### paper - On Computable Number, with an application to the ENTSCHEIDUNG 
	* read this paper with book Anotated Twins by charless 
* #### Lonson Church 
	* lambda calculaus - functional programming 

## Structured Programming 
* DJIKSTRA, DAHL, HOARE 
* GOTO considered harmful 
* #### Djikstra 
	* programs without GOTO could be proven mathematical correct 
* #### Recursive application of sequence, selection & iteration 
	* functional decomposition 
* we don't prove nowadays, we test 
* discipline imposed on direct transfer of control 

## Scheme 
* 1975 
* first real functional language 

## Object Oriented Programming
