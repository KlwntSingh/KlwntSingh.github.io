# Java

## jre 
* #### jvm 
	* class loader 
		* types of loaders 
			* bootstrap loader 
			* ext loader 
			* system/app loader 
		* three responsibilities 
			* loading 
			* linking 
			* initialization 
	* jvm memory 
		* method area 
		* heap for instance variables 
		* runtime stack area 
			* separate stack is kept for every thread 
		* pc registers 
			* to keep pointer to currently executing instruction 
			* separate registers are for every thread 
		* native method stacks 
	* execution engine 
		* executes class code line by line 
			* interpreter 
				* intprets the byte code by reading line and  line and executing it 
			* just in time compiler 
				* improves efficiency by converting byte code to native binary code and hence executing method is called again and again 
			* garbage collector 
				* removes all the unreferenced objects from memory 
	* native method interface 
* libraries
