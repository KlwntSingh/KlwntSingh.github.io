# General

## monking testing 
* testing without any knowledge of system. can be thought of same like if monkey was using the application how he will use it by putting it in random value etc 

## regression testing 
* detailed testing of complete build 
* functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change 

## smoke testing 
* initial testing of build just to check show stopper 

## difference between load and manual testing 
* #### manual testing 
	* acceptance testing 
		* to see if applicatoin is usable 
	* exploratory testing 
		* with experience and creativity new test cases to run are generated 
	* adhoc testing 
		* testing without plannig or monkey testing 
* #### automatic testing 
	* regression testing 
		* completely testing the application with new features 
	* load tsting 
		* to see application behaviour of hwo ti performs under given load 
	* performance testing 
		* to see the response time 
	* better on repeatative test cases and results which makes it difficult for humans to keep track of 
	* things to consider before going into automatic testing 
		* one time feature 
		* complexity of AUT(application under test). if planned for long term than good to automate it 
		* time constraint 
			* automation requires tiime investment and if we have enough time before project delivery 

## unit testing 
* testing of individual code modules. usually done by developers because requires deep understanding of working of module 

## integeration testing 
* testing the integerated module with system to check if it is working with system as whole 

## load testing 
* to check the volume of load, application can handle 
* to see how application behaves under load 

## performance testing 
* to check the performance of application according to business requirement 
* checking response time, time gaps, resource consumption of application 

## security testing 
* checking for any security issues that might break the application 
* security products should be tested with security testing so that there is no risk of them getting compromised 

## quality of good qa engineer 
* #### understanding the product 
	* start with black box testing, i.e testing from customer focus vision 
	* after writing black box test plan or high level test plan, than starting getting into design of application to refine the test cases 
* #### effective communcation 
	* reporting bugs to developers without offending them 
	* should not rely only on bug trackign systems 
	* reporting status reports in meetings 
* #### creativity 
	* creative to think new scenarios 
	* should keepup with the technologies, strategies to keep refining tests 
* #### development knowledge 
	* good to write automation test cases 
	* helps to find critcial part of application(dangerous to code) where thorough testing needs to done 
* #### rsults 
	* task of qa is not only to find bugs but get them fixed. communicating the bugs to development team 
	* look for any show stoppers 

## methodologies vs process 
* #### methologies 
	* ways to do any step 
	* waterfall model 
		* single iteration 
	* iterative 
		* after every iteration, we have working product 
	* agile 
		* iterative + incremental 
* #### process 
	* steps
